name: gorouter

description: "Gorouter maintains a dynamic routing table based on updates received from NATS and (when enabled) the Routing API. This routing table maps URLs to backends. The router finds the URL in the routing table that most closely matches the host header of the request and load balances across the associated backends."

properties:

    default: 80

  router.requested_route_registration_interval_in_seconds:
    description: |
      On startup, the router will delay listening for requests by this duration to increase likelihood that it has a complete routing table before serving requests.
      The router also broadcasts the same duration as a recommended interval to registering clients via NATS.
      This must be less than 60, otherwise monit will mark the process as failed.
    default: 20
  router.load_balancer_healthy_threshold:
    description: "Time period in seconds to wait until declaring the router instance started after starting the listener socket. This allows an external load balancer time to register the instance as healthy."

  router.drain_wait:
    description: |
      Delay in seconds after shut down is initiated before server stops listening.
      During this time the server will reject requests to the /health endpoint.
      This accommodates requests forwarded by a load balancer until it considers the router unhealthy.
