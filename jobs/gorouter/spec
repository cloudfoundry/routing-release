description: "Gorouter maintains a dynamic routing table based on updates received from NATS and (when enabled) the Routing API. This routing table maps URLs to backends.

      request - Gorouter will request client certificates in TLS handshakes, and will validate them when presented, but will not require them.
      require - Gorouter will fail a TLS handshake if the client does not provide a certificate signed by a CA it trusts. Select this option if your load balancer terminates TLS and does not require client certificates, and the load balancer provides a compatible client certificate of its own to Gorouter in an independent TLS handshake. This option may also be selected for Isolation Segments when Gorouter is the first point of TLS termination. Many clients of CF platform APIs do not present client certificates in TLS handshakes, so the first point of TLS termination for requests to the system domain must not require them. This option has no effect on the HTTP listener; to disable HTTP support set `disable_http: true`.

  router.forwarded_client_cert:

      How to handle the x-forwarded-client-cert (XFCC) HTTP header. Possible values are:
      - always_forward: Always forward the XFCC header in the request, regardless of whether the client connection is mTLS.
        Use this value when your load balancer is forwarding the client certificate and requests are not forwarded to Gorouter over mTLS.
        In the case where the connection between load balancer and Gorouter is mTLS, the client certificate received by Gorouter in the TLS handshake will not be put in the XFCC header.
      - forward: Forward the XFCC header received from the client only when the client connection is mTLS.
        This is a more secure version of `always_forward`. The client certificate received by Gorouter in the TLS handshake will not be put in the XFCC header.
        Requires `client_cert_validation: request` or `require`.
      - sanitize_set: Strip any instances of XFCC headers from the client request.
        When the client connection is mTLS, the client certificate received by Gorouter in the TLS handshake will be put in this header.
        Values will be base64 encoded PEM. Use this value when Gorouter is the first component to terminate TLS.
        Requires `client_cert_validation: request` or `require`.

      'deprecated' will result in all timestamps being in the format they were before the rfc3339 flag was introduced. This format is different for different logs. We do not recommend using this flag unless you have scripts that expect a particular timestamp format.
      'unix-epoch' is an old flag that we do not recommend using, but we are keeping for backwards compatibility. It will result in the gorouter logs to be in unix-epoch format. This does not effect pre-start or post-start logs. This does not effect stderr logs from golang libaries.

  router.frontend_idle_timeout:
    description: |
      (optional, integer) Duration in seconds to maintain an open connection when client supports keep-alive.
      This property must be configured with regards to how an IaaS-provided load balancer behaves in order to prevent connections from being closed prematurely.
      Generally, this timeout must be greater than that of the load balancer. As examples, GCP HTTP(S) load balancer has a default timeout of 600 seconds so a value greater than 600 is recommended and AWS ELB has a default timeout of 60 seconds so a value greater than 60 is recommended.
      However, depending on the IaaS, this timeout may need to be shorter than the load balancer's timeout, e.g., Azure's load balancer times out at 240 seconds (by default) and GCP TCP load balancer times out at 600 seconds without sending a TCP RST to clients, so a value lower than this is recommended in order to force it to send the TCP RST.

  router.set_kernel_parameters:
    description: |
      Optimize kernel networking settings for GoRouter. If you deploy GoRouter in a container set this to false.
      This configures the following kernel parameters:
        * Increases the number of allowed IP local port ranges specified by the `router.ip_local_port_range` value.
        * Reserves ports configured for gorouter and other bosh components via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_reserved_ports.
        * Reduces the timeout of TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT, so that TCP/IP can release closed connections faster, making more
          resources available for new connections.
        * Disables TCP_TW_RECYCLE to enable fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets.
        * Enables TCP_TW_REUSE to reuse sockets in TIME_WAIT state for new connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint
        * Increase the number of max queued connections than are allowed by default.

  for_backwards_compatibility_only.empty_pool_response_code_503:
    description: |
      This property is provided for backwards compatibility reasons. We recommend leaving it set to true.
      When it set to true, the gorouter will return a 503 when a route is known but there is nothing in the pool available to handle the request. When false, the gorouter will return a 404.
    default: true

  for_backwards_compatibility_only.empty_pool_timeout:
    description: |
      This property depends on empty_pool_response_code_503. If empty_pool_response_code_503 is set to true, then gorouter will consider empty_pool_timout parameter.
      If set to 0, gorouter will remove empty pools after pruning their endpoints. The gorouter will respond with 404 code.
      If set to different value, gorouter will wait until this timeout is reached then will delete the empty pools. Before pool deletion, gorouter will continue to respond with 503 code.
      The type of empty_pool_timeout is time.Duration. We have to specify the unit of time. For example, a value "10s" means 10 seconds.
    default: "0s"
