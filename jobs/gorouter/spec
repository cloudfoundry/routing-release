description: "Gorouter maintains a dynamic routing table based on updates received from NATS and (when enabled) the Routing API. This routing table maps URLs to backends. The router finds the URL in the routing table that most closely matches the host header of the request and load balances across the associated backends."

  router.requested_route_registration_interval_in_seconds:
    description: |
      On startup, the router will delay listening for requests by this duration to increase likelihood that it has a complete routing table before serving requests.
      The router also broadcasts the same duration as a recommended interval to registering clients via NATS.
      This must be less than 60, otherwise monit will mark the process as failed.

  router.forwarded_client_cert:
    description: |
      How to handle the x-forwarded-client-cert (XFCC) HTTP header. Possible values are:
      - always_forward: Always forward the XFCC header in the request, regardless of whether the client connection is mTLS.
        Use this value when your load balancer is forwarding the client certificate and requests are not forwarded to Gorouter over mTLS. In the case where the connection between load balancer and Gorouter is mTLS, the client certificate received by Gorouter in the TLS handshake will not be forwarded.
      - forward: Forward the XFCC header received from the client only when the client connection is mTLS.
        This is a more secure version of `always_forward`. The client certificate received by Gorouter in the TLS handshake will not be forwarded.
        Requires `client_cert_validation: request` or `require`.
      - sanitize_set: Strip any instances of XFCC headers from the client request.
        When the client connection is mTLS, the client certificate received by Gorouter in the TLS handshake will be forwarded in this header.
        Values will be base64 encoded PEM. Use this value when Gorouter is the first component to terminate TLS.
        Requires `client_cert_validation: request` or `require`.
    default: always_forward

  router.frontend_idle_timeout:
    description: |
      (optional, integer) Duration in seconds to maintain an open connection when client supports keep-alive.
      This property must be configured with regards to how an IaaS-provided load balancer behaves in order to prevent connections from being closed prematurely.
      Generally, this timeout must be greater than that of the load balancer. As examples, GCP has a default timeout of 600 seconds so a value greater than 600 is recommended and AWS ELB has a default timeout of 60 seconds so a value greater than 60 is recommended.
      However, depending on the IaaS, this timeout may need to be shorter than the load balancer's timeout, e.g., Azure's load balancer times out at 240 seconds (by default) without sending a TCP RST to clients, so a value lower than this is recommended in order to force it to send the TCP RST.
    default: 900

  router.backends.enable_tls:
    description:
      (optional, boolean) By default, Gorouter forwards requests to backends over unencrypted connections and will ignore routes registered with a TLS port,
