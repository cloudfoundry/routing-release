    # TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT
    # This setting determines the time that must elapse before TCP/IP can release a closed connection and reuse
    # its resources. During this TIME_WAIT state, reopening the connection to the client costs less than establishing
    # a new connection. By reducing the value of this entry, TCP/IP can release closed connections faster, making more
    # resources available for new connections. Adjust this in the presence of many connections sitting in the
    # TIME_WAIT state:

    echo 5 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout

    # TCP_TW_RECYCLE
    # It enables fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets. The default value is 0 (disabled). The sysctl documentation
    # incorrectly states the default as enabled. It can be changed to 1 (enabled) in many cases. Known to cause some
    # issues with hoststated (load balancing and fail over) if enabled, should be used with caution.

    echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle

    # TCP_TW_REUSE
    # This allows reusing sockets in TIME_WAIT state for new connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint.
    # Default value is 0 (disabled). It is generally a safer alternative to tcp_tw_recycle
