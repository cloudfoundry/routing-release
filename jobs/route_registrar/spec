  route_registrar.routes:
    description: |
      (required, array of objects): Routes that will be registered

      route object
        name (required, string, for all routes): Human-readable reference for the route
        type (optional, string, for all routes): Defaults to http, can specify http, sni, or tcp.
        uris (required, array, for http routes): When Gorouter receives a request that matches one of these URIs,
          it will forward them to the IP of the host on which route_registrar runs, and either port or tls_port.
        sni_port (required, integer, for sni rotues): When sni type provided, this is the downstream port to route to
        port (required, integer, for all routes): Either `port` or `tls_port` are required; if both are provided, Gorouter will prefer tls_port.
          Requests for associated URIs will be forwarded unencypted by the router to this port.
          The IP is determined automatically from the host on which route-registrar is run.
        tls_port (required, integer, for http routes): Either `port` or `tls_port` are required; if both are provided, Gorouter will prefer tls_port.
          Requests for associated URIs will be forwarded over TLS by the router to this port.
          The IP is determined automatically from the host on which route-registrar is run.
        route_service_url (optional, string, for http routes): When valid route service URL is provided, Gorouter will proxy requests received for the uris above to the specified route service URL.
        server_cert_domain_san (conditional, string, for http routes): Required if tls_port is present.
          Gorouter will validate that the TLS certificate presented by the destination host contains this as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
        registration_interval (required, string, for all routes): Interval between heartbeated route registrations
          (e.g. 10s). It must parse to a positive time duration i.e. "-5s" is not permitted.
        tags (optional, array of objects, for http routes): Arbitrary key-value pairs emitted with metrics to support
          filtering of metrics
        prepend_instance_index (optional, boolean, for http routes): When set to true the values in `uris` will be
          prepended with the instance index. e.g. 'some-uri.system-domain.com' will become '0-some-uri.system-domain.com' on the instance with index 0, and '2-some-url.system-domain.com' on the instance with index 2. When this value is enabled, each instance will register its own, unique, set of uris. To additionally continue to register these original uris, create another route with the same uris and set 'prepend_instance_index' to false (or omit the key entirely).
        health_check (optional, object, for all routes): Script executed on frequency of `registration_interval`. If
          healthcheck script exits with success, route registration heartbeat is sent. If script exits
          with error, the route is unregistered.
        router_group (required, string, for tcp routes): Name of the router group to which the TCP route should be added.
        external_port (required, string, for tcp routes): Port that the TCP router will listen on.
        server_cert_domain_name_modifier (optional, string, for sni routes): a regex replace to help with complicated hostnames

      health_check object
        name (required, string): Human-readable reference for the healthcheck
        script_path (required, string): Path to script that will be run periodically to determine
          service health
        timeout (optional, string): The healthcheck script must exit within this timeout, otherwise
          the script is terminated with `SIGKILL` and the route is unregistered. Value is a string (e.g. "10s") and must parse to a positive time duration i.e. "-5s" is not permitted. Must be less than the value of `registration_interval`.
          Default: Half of the value of `registration_interval`

      - name: my-service
        uris:
          - my-service.system-domain.com
