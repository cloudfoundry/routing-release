  routing_api.sqldb.max_open_connections:
    description: |
      Maximum number of open connections to the SQL database.
      The number of necessary connections will scale with the number of requests to the `/routing/...` cf api endpoints.
    default: 200

  routing_api.sqldb.max_idle_connections:

  routing_api.sqldb.connections_max_lifetime_seconds:
    description: |
      Sets the maximum amount of time a connection may be reused. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse.
      If value <= 0, connections are reused forever.
      If there is a spike in connection usage, all of these connections have the potential to stick around with a high lifetime.
      Lowering the lifetime will result in connections getting reaped sooner, but the routing-api may have to renegotiate connections
      more often, which could add some latency. We recommend using the default unless you have seen specific needs to change it.

    description: "OAuth client ids and secrets provided via link to jobs in other BOSH deployments that need to read and/or write to Routing API. These clients must be configured in UAA via API or using the property uaa.clients with the desired scopes. For a list of scopes supported see https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-api/blob/master/docs/api_docs.md. Jobs consuming the link should use these credentials to fetch a token from UAA with which to authenticate with Routing API."
